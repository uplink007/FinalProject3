# Matt Cale, a reviewer for Ruthlessreviews.com, said: "Based on my initial, purely gut reaction, TARGET is a visual masterpiece, but also the sort of story that contains layer after layer of insight. I wouldn̢���t argue that I understood everything after one viewing, but I̢���m so intrigued that I want to read more reviews, scan a few clips, and even revisit the film in its entirety. It̢���s the sort of film made for contemplation; so mysterious and so blissfully unconcerned with immediate gratification that I have no doubt it will begin the slow climb up the list of films near and dear to my heart." Members of Variety opened their review with: "Raw fare is sometimes high adventure and exciting, at other times dull in its so-called symbolism. Too often, it turns out to be a pot-pourri of ravenous eating and blatant sex", referring to the films violence and sexual overtones.
