- For any a ∈ G , a + 0 = 0 + a = a. 0 thus plays the role of an additive identity element or neutral element .
- For any a ∈ G , a + ( − a ) = ( − a ) + a = 0 .

Let N be an associative algebra over a field F with the property that for any x ∈ N , there exists y ∈ N such that x + y + xy = 0 .
( in other words , N is a radical ring ) .
Then , the ALGEBRA GROUP corresponding to N is the adjoint group of N , i.e. , the group whose elements are formally : { 1 + x | x ∈ N } where the multiplication is defined as : ( 1 + x ) ( 1 + y ) = 1 + ( x + y + xy ) There are two interpretations of this : We can think of the algebra group as living inside the unitization N + F as the coset of N for 1 ∈ F. Alternatively , since there is a bijection between N and its algebra group , we can think of the algebra group as simply the set N with group operation x * y : = x + y + xy .
This is based on the idea of the multiplicative formal group law .
However , unlike other formal group laws , the multiplicative formal group law is valid even in _ non-commutative _ settings , and that is necessary for this definition .
If N is an associative algebra over a field F with the property that every element of N is nilpotent , then it is true that for any x ∈ N , there exists y ∈ N such that x + y + xy = 0 .
Thus , we can always define the algebra group corresponding to any such algebra N .
If F is a finite field and N is a finite-dimensional associative algebra over F , the following are equivalent : For any x ∈ N , there exists y ∈ N such that x + y + xy = 0 .
Every element of N is nilpotent .
N is a nilpotent algebra , i.e. , there is some fixed length such that all products of that length of elements in N equal zero .
Thus , for a finite-dimensional associative algebra over a finite field F , we talk of its algebra group only if it satisfies these equivalent conditions .
A group of prime power order which can be realized as an algebra group any finite field is termed an ALGEBRA GROUP .
Note that an algebra group over 𝔽 _ ( q ) , where q is a power of a prime p , must also be an algebra group over the prime field 𝔽 _ ( p ) .
Thus , saying that a finite p-group is an algebra group is equivalent to saying that it is an algebra group over 𝔽 _ ( p ) .

Suppose H is a subgroup of a group G .
We say that H is a DIRECT FACTOR OVER CENTRAL SUBGROUP of G if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions : There exists a subgroup A of H such that A is a central subgroup of G and H/A is a direct factor of the quotient group G/A .
In the quotient map ρ : G → G/Z ( G ) , where Z ( G ) is the center of G , ρ ( H ) is a direct factor of ρ ( G ) = G/Z ( G ) .

The DIRECT PRODUCT OF Z4 AND Z2 is an abelian group of order eight obtained as the external direct product of cyclic group : Z4 and cyclic group : Z2 .
If we denote by a and b the generators of the direct factors , then the presentation is given by : G : = ⟨ a , b ∣ a ⁴ = b ² = e , ab = ba ⟩ .
Writing the presentation in additive notation , with commutativity implicit : G : = ⟨ a , b ∣ 4a = 2b = 0 ⟩ .
Here , we use ordered pairs , as is typical for external direct products , with the first coordinate corresponding to the cyclic group of order four and the second coordinate corresponding to the cyclic group of order two .
From the presentation notation , a = ( 1 , 0 ) , b = ( 0 , 1 ) and ma + nb = ( m , n ) .
