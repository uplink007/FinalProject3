Let π be the set of prime divisors of the order of G. Define a relation ∼ on π as follows : for p , q ∈ π ( possibly equal , possibly distinct ) , p ∼ q if and only if either p = q or there exists a p-Sylow subgroup P of G and a q-Sylow subgroup Q of G such that the following equivalent conditions hold : There exists a non-identity element x of P and a non-identity element y of Q such that x and y commute .
Every element of P commutes with every element of Q. Note that the conditions are equivalent because uses : : Sylow subgroups for distinct primes in CN-group centralize each other iff they have non-identity elements that centralize each other .
Note also that these conditions are _ not as strong as _ the statement that every element of p-power order in G commutes with every element of q-power order .

By composition , this defines a map : Hom ( N , ℂ ^ ( ( ) ) → HOM ( H ₂ ( Q ; ℤ ) , ℂ ^ ( ) ) = H ² ( Q ; ℂ ) ( * ) ) The condition is that the image of this homomorphism should contain the cohomology class corresponding to the projective representation .

Suppose G is a finite group .
Let ℂ denote the field of complex numbers .
For each equivalence class of irreducible linear representation of G over ℂ , choose a basis such that the representation is unitary , i.e. , the image lies inside U ( n , ℂ ) .
Note that this can be done , because linear representation of finite group over complex numbers has invariant Hermitian inner product .
Now , consider the functions from G to ℂ obtained as the matrix entries for these representations .
( There are n ² functions for each representation of degree n ) .
Consider the usual Hermitian inner product on the space of complex-valued functions on G : $ \ langle f_1 , f_2 \ rangle = \ frac { 1 } { | G | } \ sum _ { g \ in G } f_1 ( g ) \ overline { f_2 ( g ) } $ Then : Any two matrix entry functions are orthogonal with respect to the inner product described above .
The inner product of any matrix entry function with itself equals $ \ frac { 1 } { n } $ where n is the degree of the representation from which it is picked .
Suppose G is a finite group .
Let k be a splitting field for G such that the characteristic of k does not divide the order of G. For every equivalence class of irreducible linear representation of G over k , choose a basis .
Now consider the functions from G to k obtained as the matrix entries of these representations .
Consider the bilinear form for functions on the group : $ \ langle f_1 , f_2 \ rangle_G = \ frac { 1 } { | G | } \ sum _ { g \ in G } f_1 ( g ) f_2 ( g ^ { -1 } ) $ Then : Matrix entries for _ distinct _ irreducible representations are orthogonal to each other , i.e. , the inner product is zero .
Matrix entries for the _ same _ irreducible representation have inner product 1/n iff the entries are _ transposes _ of each other , and have inner product zero otherwise .
